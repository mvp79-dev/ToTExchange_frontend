    "There are more than 37 trillion cells in more than 200 organ types to form our body structure. All types of cells have their own lifespan, and the lifespan of all types of organ cells are all different. Therefore, TWO (2) TRILLIONS of our body cells are regenerated every day at the end of their lifespan. In which, the mother cells copying their DNA to the daughter cells during cell replication and before apoptosis at the end of the mother-cells’ lifespan.",

These include some severe forms of inherited anemia, where inadequate replication of stem cells in bone marrow leads to a lack of red blood cells. Certain inherited diseases of the skin and lung are also related to telomerase defects (Nobel Prize Physiology or Medicine 2009).",

The enzyme telomerase consists of a protein and an RNA sequence, which extends the DNA sequence at the ends of Chromosomes, and the part functions of the RNA acts as a template for the construction of new telomere DNA. Telomerase extends the telomere, and the telomere DNA provides a platform that enables DNA polymerase to copy the entire length of the Chromosome to the daughter cells during cell replication (Nobel Prize 2009).",
